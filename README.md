# Cryptocurrencies (Clustered using Unsupervised Machine Learning)
Unsupervised Machine Learning/ PCA/ K Means/ Pandas

## Overview
In order to assist an investment banking firm in offering new cryptocurrency investment options to their customers portfolio, I have created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The following steps were used to generate this report:

1. Preprocess CryptoCompare data to make it usable for the Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
2. Reduce the Data Dimensions using PCA
3. Cluster CryptoCurrencies using K-Means
4. Vizualize CryptoCurrency results using hvPlot

## Results
View the crypto_clustering.ipynb file for report results.
